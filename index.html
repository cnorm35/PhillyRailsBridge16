          <blockquote>
            “Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines.
            They think, "By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing
            this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the
            machine will something something something." They are focusing on
            machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care
            about doing programming or operating the application of the
            machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves.”

            ### Variables
            A variable is a way to store information to be used later.

            ```sh
              > my_first_varaible = 'dog'
              => 'dog'
              > my_first_varaible
              => 'dog'
            ```
            This is called **assignment**.  We're storing the value `dog` with
            the variable `my_firs_variable`

        <!-- Slide 8-->
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### Variables

            When assigning variables, the *right side* is evaluated first, and
            the result is *assigned* to the value on the left side.

            ```sh
              > cats = 3
              => 3
              
              > dogs = 2
              => 2

              > pets = cats + dogs
              => 5
            ```
          </script>

        <!-- Slide 9-->
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### Variables

            What types of information can variables hold?

            - Strings "I am a string"
            - Numbers & results from calculations `2` `(2*3) + 4`
            - Collections
              - Arrays `[1,3,5,7]`    `['cody','norman']`
              - Hashes `{ first_name: 'Cody', last_name: 'Norman', profession:
              'Software Developer' }`
            - Booleans `true` `false`

            We're going to talk more about each one of these types.  Let's
            starts with Strings...
          </script>
        </section>
        <!-- Slide 10-->
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### Strings
            A *String* is just text.  You can use either single `'`, or double
            quotation marks `"`

            ```sh
            > 'This works'
            => 'This works'
            
            > "So does this"
            => "So does this"
            ```

            Lets create a variable `first_name` and set it equal to your first
            name

            ```sh
            > first_name = 'Cody'
            => 'Cody'
            ```
          </script>
        </section>
        <!-- Slide 11-->
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### Strings
            Now let's do the same thing with `last_name`:
            ```sh
            > last_name = 'Norman'
            => 'Norman'
            ```
            Now see what happens when we add these together
            ```sh
            > first_name + last_name
            => 'CodyNorman'
            ```
            Computers are dumb, they can only do exactly what you tell them to.
            Tell it to add a space between `first_name` and `last_name`
            ```sh
            > first_name + " " + last_name
            => "Cody Norman"
            ```
          </script>

          <script type="text/template">
            ### Strings
            String Interpolation - Fancy name, easy meaning.
            This is when you output the value of a variable inside a String.

            To use this, you **must use double quotation marks** and anything in
            between `#{}` gets evaluated as ruby code.

            Let's try to same example from before but using interpolation

            ```sh
            > "My name is #{first_name} #{last_name}"
            => "My name is Cody Norman"

            > "Three + Four is: #{ 3 + 4 }"
            => "Three + Four is: 7"
            ```

            ### Strings

            Ruby also gives us some handy methods to use on strings.  this is
            part of the fun when programming in ruby.

            ```sh
            > activity = "learning ruby"
            => "learning ruby"
            
            > activity.upcase
            => "LEARNING RUBY"

            > activity.capitalize
            => "Learning ruby"
            ```
          </script>

        <!-- slide 14-->
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### Numbers
            There are 2 basic types of numbers: 

            - `Integers` - whole numbers without decimal points
              - `3   5  13  -21`
            - `Floats` - numbers with decimal points.
              - `0.0  3.14  0.0034`

            Numbers have few basic operations you can perform with them.

        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
            ### Using Operators with Numbers
            `Addition: +`
            ```sh
              > 3 + 4
              => 7
            ```
            
            `subtraction: -`
            ```sh
              > 4 - 2
              => 2
            ```
            
            `Multiplication: *`
            ```sh
            > 15 * 10
            => 150
            ```
            
            `Division: /`
            ```sh
            > 10 / 3
            => 3
            ```
          </script>
        </section>
        <!-- Slide 16 -->
        <section data-markdown>
          <!-- thinking about remobing modulo from this section -->
          <!-- make smaller or cut into 2 slides -->
          <script type="text/template">
            Wait...what was that?  Did you catch what happened with `Division`?
            
            `Division: /`
            ```sh
            > 10 / 3
            => 3
            ```

            Ruby returned `3` instead of `3.333333`
            When you're dividing with two `Integers` ruby assumes you would like
            it to return an `Integer` as the result.  If you would like decimals
            returned with your answer, you need to use a `Float` since Intergers
            can not have any decimals

            ```sh
              > 10 / 3.0
              => 3.33333333
            ```

          <script type="text/template">
            ### Booleans

            Booleans are either `true` or `false`
            
            ```sh
            first_name == last_name
            => false

            first_name == 'Cody'

            ### Collections
            Back to the two types of Collections we metioned earlier:
            `Arrays` and `Hashes`
            
            `Array`:
            ```sh
              my_array = ['my', 'first', 'array']
              => ['my', 'first', 'array']
            ```

            `Hash`:
            ```
              my_hash = { first_hash: true, total_hashes: 0 }
            ```
          </script>
        </section>
        <!-- Slide 19 -->
        <section data-markdown>
          <!-- Look into hash being highlighted wrong -->
          <script type="text/template">
            ### Arrays
            An `Array` is a list surrounded with square brackets

            ```sh
              coding_languages = ['ruby', 'javascript', 'elixir']
              => ['ruby', 'javascript', 'elixir']
            ```

            Arrays can hold other arrays, strings, and variables

            When an `array` contains another `array`, we call this a nested
            array.
            ```sh
              nested_array = ['string value', ['another', 'array'], first_name]
              => ['string value', ['another', 'array'], 'Cody']
            ```
          </script>

          <!-- Look into hash being highlighted wrong -->
          <script type="text/template">
            ### Arrays
            Each value inside an array has an *index*.  An index is the item's
            position in the array **starting at 0**.
            
            ```sh
              > coding_languages[0]
              => 'ruby'

              > coding_languages[1]
              => 'javascript'

              > coding_languages[2]
              => 'elixir'

              > coding_languages[5]
              => nil    (think of this as rubys way of saying nothing)
            ```

          <script type="text/template">
            ### Arrays

            Just like Strings, Arrays have some handy methods available to us.

            ```sh
            > coding_languages.first
            => 'ruby'

            > coding_languages.last
            => 'elixir'

          <script type="text/template">
            ### Hashes

            Hashes are filled with `key: value` pairs.  They look like this
            `my_info = {first_name: 'Cody', last_name: 'Norman', occupation:
            'Software Developer' }`

            Instead of using an index to refer to a value, we use it's `key`
            instead.

            ```sh
              > my_info[:fist_name]
              => 'Cody'
            ```
          </script>

            ### Hashes

            **Hash Syntax**
            Hashes are surrounded with `{ }` and `key: value` pairs seperated by
            a comma.

            Since we refer to a Hashes value by it's `key`, each `key` needs to
            be unique

            There are 2 different ways to declare `key: value` pairs inside a
            Hash.  

            The older Hash Rocket syntax, and the current one using colons.

            ### Methods

            Methods allow us to reuse bits of other code.  Ruby comes with a lot
            of pre-defined methods that can be called with
            *`.name_of_the_method`*.  We already saw a few of these with Arrays and
            Strings.  Each type we've talked about so far (called Classes
            (should you add something about Classes?) ) has their own set of
            methods.

            ```sh
              > first_name.class
              => String

              > first_name.upcase
              => "CODY"

              > first_name.downcase
              => "cody"

              > first_name.capitalize
              => "Cody"
            ```

            You can also create your own methods

              >   puts 'my first method'
              > end

              => :my_method

              > my_method
              my fist method
              => nil

            Ruby will evaluate your conditional from top to bottom, as soon as
            is finds a condition that is `true` it executes the code beneath
            that statement and exits the conditional.  Ruby doesn't bother
            checking the other values since it has already found one thats `true`
            
            ```ruby
              age = 30

              if age >= 18
                #ruby sees this is true and runs this code
                puts 'you can vote'
                # after this code is ran, ruby exits, never checking the other
                # conditions
              elsif age >= 21
                puts 'you can drink'

            **Directory**

            What is a directory?
            
            A directory is a folder that contain other directories or files
            

            **Current Directory**

            You're always inside a directory.  The see where you're at in your
            file systemy run the command `pwd`.  This stands for 'print working
            directory'.

            ```sh
            $ pwd
            /Users/Cody/Code/Presentations/intro_to_ruby
            ```

            To see a list of files inside the `directory` that you are
            currently in use the `ls` command:

            ```sh

            **Change Directory**

            to move to another directory, we can use the `cd` command followed
            by the directory we would like to move to.

            ```sh
            $ cd Code

            **Change Directory**

            To change into the directory directly *above* the one your're
            currently in. We can use the shortcut `..` as the path to our `cd`
            command.

            ```sh
            $ pwd

            /Users/Cody/Code

            $ cd ..

            **Change Directory**

            When giving a file to the `cd` command, you can use either a
            `full_path` which is the path of that directory starting from the
            top level 
            
            `$ cd /Users/Cody/Code`
            
            or a `relative_path` which is
            based on where we are currently at inside our file system (to find
            this out, run `pwd`)

            *relative path*
            
            With a `relative path`, you dont have to pass the whole path from
            the top, just based on the directory where youre currently at.


            ```sh
              $ pwd

              /Users/Cody/Code

              $ cd Presentations

            *change directory* shortcuts

            To get to your home path, just run `cd` with no path

            ```sh

              $ pwd

            ```

            To get to the last directory you were in use `-` (dash) as the path to the
            `cd` command

            ```sh
              $ cd -

              $ pwd

            ###Creating new files

            To create a new file, we can use the `touch` command.  `touch` will
            create a new file for us *if there is not one already present*

            ```sh
              $ touch my_first_file.txt

              $ ls

              my_first_file.txt

              $ touch my_first_file.txt

              $ ls

              my_first_file.txt
            ```

            We do not create a duplicate file if one already exists
